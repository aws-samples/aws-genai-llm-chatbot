# ⚠️ Precautions ⚠️

Before you begin using the solution, there are certain precautions you must take into account:

- **Cost Management with self-hosted models on SageMaker**: Be mindful of the costs associated with AWS resources, especially with SageMaker models billed by the hour. While the sample is designed to be cost-effective, leaving serverful resources running for extended periods or deploying numerous LLMs/MLMs can quickly lead to increased costs.

- **Licensing obligations**: If you choose to use any datasets or models alongside the provided samples, ensure you check the LLM code and comply with all licensing obligations attached to them.

- **This is a sample**: the code provided in this repository shouldn't be used for production workloads without further reviews and adaptation.
