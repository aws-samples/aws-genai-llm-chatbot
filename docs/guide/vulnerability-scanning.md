You should not use this AWS Content or Third-Party Content in your production accounts, or on production or other critical data. You are responsible for testing, securing, and optimizing the AWS Content or Third-Party Content, such as sample code, as appropriate for production grade use based on your specific quality control practices and standards. Deploying AWS Content or Third-Party Content may incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS chargeable resources, such as running Amazon EC2 instances or using Amazon S3 storage.

## Automated Scans
To ensure security of the project, a number of automated tools have been utilized. Information on each can be found below.

The results of the below tools are valid as of November 24th 2023.
### JavaScript/TypeScript
#### Semgrep
[Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep) scans code and package dependencies for known issues, software vulnerabilities, and detected secrets.

No blocking findings have been found.

#### npm-audit
The audit command for npm (`npm audit`) reports on known vulnerabilities of dependencies configured in a project.

No findings.
### Python
#### Bandit
[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. Bandit has been run against the Python files written for this project. 

The below outstanding high severity finding remains. This has not been remediated as the code only runs in CodeBuild as part of the deployment process, therefore not exposing it to malicious injection.

```
Issue: [B602:subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true] subprocess call with shell=True identified, security issue.
Location: /lib/sagemaker-model/hf-custom-script-model/build-script/script.py:63
```

### CDK Templates
#### cdk_nag
[cdk_nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag/) checks CDK applications for best practices using a combination of available rule packs.

A number of rules have been suppressed. Each suppression is accompanied by a reason.

### Git
#### git-secrets
[git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) scans commits, commit messages and `--no-ff` merges to prevent adding secrets into your git repositories. 

No findings.
