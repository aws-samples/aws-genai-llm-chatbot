# Deploy

## Environment setup

### Deploy with AWS Cloud9

We recommend deploying with [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/).
If you'd like to use Cloud9 to deploy the solution, you will need the following before proceeding:

- select at least `m5.large` as Instance type.
- use `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS` as the platform.

### Deploy with Github Codespaces

If you'd like to use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to deploy the solution, you will need the following before proceeding:

1. An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
2. An [IAM User](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/users/create) with:

- `AdministratorAccess` policy granted to your user (for production, we recommend restricting access as needed)
- Take note of `Access key` and `Secret access key`.

To get started, click on the button below.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/aws-samples/aws-genai-llm-chatbot)

Once in the Codespaces terminal, set up the AWS Credentials by running

```shell
aws configure
```

```shell
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <the access key from the IAM user generated above>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <the secret access key from the IAM user generated above>
Default region name: <the region you plan to deploy the solution to>
Default output format: json
```

You are all set for deployment; you can now jump to [.3 of the deployment section below](#deployment-dependencies-installation).

### Local deployment

If you have decided not to use AWS Cloud9 or GitHub Codespaces, verify that your environment satisfies the following prerequisites:

You have:

1. An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
2. `AdministratorAccess` policy granted to your AWS account (for production, we recommend restricting access as needed)
3. Both console and programmatic access
4. [NodeJS 16 or 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

   - If you are using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) you can run the following before proceeding
   - ```
     nvm install 16 && nvm use 16

     or

     nvm install 18 && nvm use 18
     ```

5. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured to use with your AWS account
6. [Typescript 3.8+](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) installed
7. [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) installed
8. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
   - N.B. [`buildx`](https://github.com/docker/buildx) is also required. For Windows and macOS `buildx` [is included](https://github.com/docker/buildx#windows-and-macos) in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
9. [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genai-llm-chatbot
```

2. Move into the cloned repository

```bash
cd aws-genai-llm-chatbot
```

#### (Optional) Only for Cloud9

If you use Cloud9, increase the instance's EBS volume to at least 100GB.
To do this, run the following command from the Cloud9 terminal:

```
./scripts/cloud9-resize.sh
```

See the documentation for more details [on environment resize](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/move-environment.html#move-environment-resize).

<a id="deployment-dependencies-installation"></a> 3. Install the project dependencies and build the project by running this command

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

4. Once done, run the magic-config CLI to help you set up the solution with the features you care most:

```bash
npm run create
```

You'll be prompted to configure the different aspects of the solution, such as:

- The LLMs or MLMs to enable (we support all models provided by Bedrock along with SageMaker hosted Idefics, FalconLite, Mistral and more to come)
- Setup of the RAG system: engine selection (i.e. Aurora w/ pgvector, OpenSearch, Kendra..) embeddings selection and more to come.
- Private Chatbot: Limit accessibility to website and backend to VPC.

When done, answer `Y` to create or update your configuration.

![sample](./assets/magic-create-sample.gif "CLI sample")

Your configuration is now stored under `bin/config.json`. You can re-run the magic-config command as needed to update your `config.json`

5. (Optional) Bootstrap AWS CDK on the target account and region

> **Note**: This is required if you have never used AWS CDK on this account and region combination. ([More information on CDK bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html#cli-bootstrap)).

```bash
npx cdk bootstrap aws://{targetAccountId}/{targetRegion}
```

You can now deploy by running:

```bash
npx cdk deploy
```

> **Note**: This step duration can vary greatly, depending on the Constructs you are deploying.

You can view the progress of your CDK deployment in the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) in the selected region.

6. Once deployed, take note of the `User Interface`, `User Pool` and, if you want to interact with [3P models providers](#3p-models-providers), the `Secret` that will, eventually, hold the various `API_KEYS` should you want to experiment with 3P providers.

```bash
...
Outputs:
GenAIChatBotStack.UserInterfaceUserInterfaceDomanNameXXXXXXXX = dxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net
GenAIChatBotStack.AuthenticationUserPoolLinkXXXXX = https://xxxxx.console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/v2/idp/user-pools/xxxxx_XXXXX/users?region=xxxxx
GenAIChatBotStack.ApiKeysSecretNameXXXX = ApiKeysSecretName-xxxxxx
...
```

7. Open the generated **Cognito User Pool** Link from outputs above i.e. `https://xxxxx.console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/v2/idp/user-pools/xxxxx_XXXXX/users?region=xxxxx`

8. Add a user that will be used to log into the web interface.

9. Open the `User Interface` Url for the outputs above, i.e. `dxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net`

10. Login with the user created in .8; you will be asked to change the password.

## Run user interface locally

See instructions in the README file of the [`lib/user-interface/react-app`](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genai-llm-chatbot/blob/main/lib/user-interface/react-app/README.md) folder.

## Using Kendra with a non-english index

If you're using Kendra with an index in a language other than English, you will need to make some code modifications.

You'll need to modify the filters in the file `lib/shared/layers/python-sdk/python/genai_core/kendra/query.py`.

Example for french :

```python
    if kendra_index_external or kendra_use_all_data:
        result = kendra.retrieve(
            IndexId=kendra_index_id,
            QueryText=query,
            PageSize=limit,
            PageNumber=1,
            AttributeFilter={'AndAllFilters': [{"EqualsTo": {"Key": "_language_code","Value": {"StringValue": "fr"}}}]}
        )
    else:
        result = kendra.retrieve(
            IndexId=kendra_index_id,
            QueryText=query,
            PageSize=limit,
            PageNumber=1,
            AttributeFilter={'AndAllFilters':
                [
                    {"EqualsTo": {"Key": "_language_code","Value": {"StringValue": "fr"}}},
                    {"EqualsTo": {"Key": "workspace_id","Value": {"StringValue": workspace_id}}}
                ]
            }
        )
```

Please note: If these adjustments are made post-deployment, it's essential to rebuild and redeploy. If done prior to deployment, you can proceed with the walkthrough as usual.

```bash
npm install && npm run build
npx cdk deploy
```

## Clean up

You can remove the stacks and all the associated resources created in your AWS account by running the following command:

```bash
npx cdk destroy
```

> **Note**: Depending on which resources have been deployed. Destroying the stack might take a while, up to 45m. If the deletion fails multiple times, please manually delete the remaining stack's ENIs; you can filter ENIs by VPC/Subnet/etc using the search bar [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#NIC) in the AWS console) and re-attempt a stack deletion.
