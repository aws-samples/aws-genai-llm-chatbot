# How We Prioritize: GenAI Chatbot on AWS Solution

## Introduction

At AWS, we strive to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the broader community. This document outlines our approach to prioritizing work for the GenAI Chatbot on AWS Solution.

## Document Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide transparency into the factors we consider when prioritizing work related to the GenAI Chatbot on AWS Solution. Our goal is to deliver tangible value to our users on a predictable and frequent schedule, while maintaining a balance between community feedback, customer requests, partner collaborations, and internal priorities.

## Prioritization Factors

We prioritize work based on several factors, including community feedback, customer requests, partner collaborations, and internal priorities. While community feedback is heavily weighted, there may be instances where other factors take precedence. Here's a breakdown of the various sources of input we consider:

### Community

Our vibrant community of users and contributors plays a crucial role in shaping the direction of the GenAI Chatbot on AWS Solution. We closely monitor and prioritize issues and pull requests that receive significant community attention, as indicated by reactions, comments, and links to related issues or PRs. Issues with the most community support are given high priority, and we strive to provide timelines for addressing them whenever possible.

### Customer Requests

We value feedback and feature requests from AWS customers, which are typically escalated through various channels, such as customer support, sales engineering, or AWS Solutions Architects. During a weekly triage process, we assess these requests based on the following criteria:

- Community support for the requested feature or issue
- Relevance to our core services and offerings

Customer requests with substantial community support or those pertaining to our core services are more likely to be prioritized.


### Internal Priorities

In addition to external inputs, we consider several internal factors when prioritizing work:

1. **SDK/Core Updates**: We strive to keep the GenAI Chatbot on AWS Solution up-to-date with minor SDK releases, which are automatically pulled in through our automation processes. Major SDK releases with breaking changes may require us to release a new major version of the solution, which we aim to limit.

2. **Technical Debt**: We allocate capacity for addressing technical debt in every iteration. Minor technical debt items can be addressed by engineers as needed, while larger items are discussed and prioritized during dedicated technical debt review meetings.

3. **Adverse User Experience or Security Vulnerabilities**: Issues that negatively impact user experience, such as bugs or crashes, or those that pose security risks, are always given high priority for inclusion in upcoming releases. The severity of these issues determines how quickly they are addressed.

## Conclusion

At AWS, we strive to balance the diverse needs and inputs of our community, customers, partners, and internal stakeholders when prioritizing work for the GenAI Chatbot on AWS Solution. By being transparent about our prioritization process, we hope to foster a better understanding of why certain features, improvements, or bug fixes are prioritized over others. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality solution that provides tangible value to our users on a predictable and frequent schedule.
